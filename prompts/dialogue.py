wake = ["Must you always interrupt my centuries of contemplation?","A millennium of wisdom and this is what I’m woken for?","I’ve survived a thousand years of interruptions, but this one truly tests my patience.","You’ve disturbed thoughts older than your entire lineage... why!?","I was dreaming of a cure for death itself… and now I’m awake... Why!?","Is it truly worth waking someone who has mastered the art of eternal rest?","After all these centuries, you'd think I’d earned a bit of uninterrupted sleep.","I was reflecting on the mysteries of the universe… care to explain why I’ve been pulled from it!?","For a thousand years, I've weathered much, but being woken for trivial matters tests even me.","You rouse me from profound slumber… surely there's an earth-shattering reason?"]

pause = ["Hmmm... give me a moment...","Mmm... let me ponder that...","Hmmm... now, where was I?","Ahh... let me consider this...","Hmm... I need a moment to reflect...","Mmm... allow me to think for a second...","Hmmm... let's see here...","Hmmm... I need to mull this over...","Hmm... let me wrap my mind around it...","Ahh... give me a minute to gather my thoughts..."]
